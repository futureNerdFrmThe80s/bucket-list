Today, I worked on:

* Fixing issues with API calls - Set up PGadmin

Having issues with API calls. API call only retrieves one park out 
of hundreds of parks. Attempted to adjust poller.py and Park model.
Decided to run the poller once every 24hrs since national parks don't 
update often. Going to add the weather API that will update more 
frequently on the hour. Went into PGadmin and set up the volume.

Today, I worked on:

* Setting up poller

Struggled a lot today with the poller. We had some issues with what we think 
was naming our database variables. We learned about script files that can 
run multiple commands and make the process of stopping, building and running 
the docker containers much faster. We separated the poller into its own 
container.
