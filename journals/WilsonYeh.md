Today Liam and I worked on user auth. Liam was able to get the user login form rendered, while I worked on rendering sign up form, and we felt it was important to get this part working before we could test users/user auth.

Today I think we were finally able to resolve the issues with our poller. With a lot of troubleshooting, we have gotten the NPS_API_KEY to be hidden and recognized in our poller dynamically, and is no longer shown when someone pulls the most recent commits. 

*Tomorrow, I believe we can now begin to divide the work - some of us could perhaps go move into the work of user authentication and the others could move into front-end development.

Lots of troubleshooting today, but we made some progress - needed to revert back to an old YAML and test from there.

We were trying to troubleshoot issues we were having with getting user authentication working properly.

I was able to take on the role of driver this afternoon, while Liam was the navigator. This allowed me to take a shot at what felt like 'true' pair programming talking through my thought process and having someone else be the sort of eyes, incase I had missed something. We were able to get our requests to return what we had expected and only experienced a small hic-up that was quickly resolved.

We had taken roles as driver/navigators for today to help develop our models and taking some time to work through this type of coding to gain some experience talking through our code and our logic of getting something to work the way we intend. These seemingly 'easy' tasks can prove to be quite difficult when the spotlight is shining on us.

* Setting up Docker and Journal entries

Working through getting docker setup and running
Was having some compatibility issues some how missed the 'gitattributes' 
and could not get docker containers working properly on PC. Although
this was not an issue for Sergey. Grateful for Adrian for pointing this out, Jason's assistance and the teams help for all the extra eyes. In the end, it took nuking the repo from my local machine and having Liam push the gitattributes so I could clone the repo again.
