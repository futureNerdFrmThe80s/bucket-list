The ultimate shopping list for your bucket list

## Intended Market

outdoorsy people - or those that want to get outside more - instead of being stuck infront of a computer all day...
Our intended market of users for this would be 'weekend warriors' or travelers who are looking to enjoy adventures that are more outdoors oriented - here they are able to look up places of interest and possibly find others who have visited and see their comments on a park. On each page theyre able to check valuable information on a states park such as weather, activities, and amenities. 


* possible ad revenue from vendors - REI/ outdoor retailers/ travel sites/ 
* travelers looking to visit state park areas
* 

## Functionality 
** uses NPS API to retrieve data for parks **
** uses Weather API to retrieve weather data for parks **
** Users are those who have created an account ** 

* anyone can create an account
    * users can edit their profile/account
    * add pinned parks to your account - create their 'bucket list' of places they want to/ intend on visiting
    * pinned parks can be 'checked off' after youve made your visit to the park 
    * users will have a history of parks theyve visited/checked off their bucket list 
* search states for parks - to list parks in the state  
    * unlock additional info from parks after login/signing up to encourage users to create an account
    * include weather conditions for parks
* users can leave comments on a park/ park rating system?
* amenities - parking/ restrooms/ food/ camping
* activities to do at the parks
* articles of the park/ info? 

*** achievements - something used to track how many parks a user has visited; at some thresholds users gain medals or accolades
*** social aspect 
*** live feed from area if cam is available - some parks have ranger cameras if we are able to find a way to tap into their feeds we can include these as part of a parks page information (can also make this available for users after signup)
