Today, I worked on:

* Updating Docker and creating the React App

We fixed PostgresSQL errors while transitioning 
from SQLite. YAML file needed some adjusting to 
satisfy the PostgreSQL requirements. I created the 
React App and tested the local host. Adjusted the 
directories to be more organized. Everything is working
as of now. Meeting with the team to discuss functionality.
