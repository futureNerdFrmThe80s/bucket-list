Today, I worked on:

I was able to take on the role of driver this afternoon, while Liam was the navigator. This allowed me to take a shot at what felt like 'true' pair programming talking through my thought process and having someone else be the sort of eyes, incase I had missed something. We were able to get our requests to return what we had expected and only experienced a small hic-up that was quickly resolved.

Today, I worked on:

We had taken roles as driver/navigators for today to help develop our models and taking some time to work through this type of coding to gain some experience talking through our code and our logic of getting something to work the way we intend. These seemingly 'easy' tasks can prove to be quite difficult when the spotlight is shining on us.

Today, I worked on:

* Setting up Docker and Journal entries

Working through getting docker setup and running
Was having some compatibility issues some how missed the 'gitattributes' 
and could not get docker containers working properly on PC. Although
this was not an issue for Sergey. Grateful for Adrian for pointing this out, Jason's assistance and the teams help for all the extra eyes. In the end, it took nuking the repo from my local machine and having Liam push the gitattributes so I could clone the repo again.
