Today, I worked on:

* Setting up Docker and Journal entries

Working through getting docker setup and running
Was having some compatibility issues some how missed the 'gitattributes' 
and could not get docker containers working properly on PC. Although
this was not an issue for Sergey. Grateful for Adrian for pointing this out, Jason's assistance and the teams help for all the extra eyes. In the end, it took nuking the repo from my local machine and having Liam push the gitattributes so I could clone the repo again.
