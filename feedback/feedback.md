## Dalonte 7/7

From Slack:

GM!  Very clever concept and full disclosure I'm a card carrying REI member :).  I also like the great functionality and early identification of 3rd party API's.  I'm eager to see the end product and would like the group to reconsider or re-label some of the concepts as 'stretch' functionality. 
- Pls consider non-registered-user functionality, if applicable  
- fyi, check out the Avenza Maps app - very similar features
